# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Court Aggregator application currently has an issue where items don't display on initial page load until the user refreshes the page. This occurs because the frontend initialization sequence doesn't properly wait for asynchronous data loading operations to complete before rendering the calendar interface. The parks data and calendar data loading operations are not properly coordinated, resulting in an empty calendar display on first load.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user visiting the Court Aggregator application, I want to see court availability data immediately on the first page load, so that I don't need to refresh the page to view the information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads for the first time THEN the system SHALL display court availability data without requiring a page refresh
2. WHEN the parks data is being loaded THEN the system SHALL wait for parks loading to complete before rendering the calendar
3. WHEN both parks and calendar data are loading THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading indicators to inform the user
4. WHEN data loading fails THEN the system SHALL display meaningful error messages and fallback gracefully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see loading indicators during the initial data fetch, so that I understand the application is working and loading data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts loading data THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator
2. WHEN parks data is being fetched THEN the system SHALL show loading state for the park filter sidebar
3. WHEN calendar data is being fetched THEN the system SHALL show loading state for the calendar area
4. WHEN all data has loaded successfully THEN the system SHALL hide all loading indicators and display the content

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle network errors gracefully during initial load, so that I can still use the application even if some data is unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parks data fails to load THEN the system SHALL use default park configuration and display a warning message
2. WHEN calendar data fails to load THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message with retry options
3. WHEN network requests timeout THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about the timeout and suggest refresh
4. WHEN partial data loads successfully THEN the system SHALL display available data and indicate what is missing
