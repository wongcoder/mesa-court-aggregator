# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create tunnel startup script with environment validation
  - Write shell script that checks for CLOUDFLARED_TOKEN and starts tunnel accordingly
  - Include error handling and logging for missing or invalid tokens
  - Add fallback behavior when tunnel is disabled
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.3, 4.4_

- [x] 2. Create supervisord configuration for multi-process management
  - Write supervisord.conf with separate program sections for Node.js and cloudflared
  - Configure proper logging to stdout/stderr for Docker compatibility
  - Set appropriate restart policies for each service
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.3_

- [x] 3. Update Dockerfile to install cloudflared and supervisord
  - Add cloudflared binary installation for ARM64 architecture
  - Install supervisord package from Alpine repositories
  - Copy configuration files and set proper permissions
  - Maintain existing security practices with non-root user
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.1_

- [x] 4. Modify Dockerfile CMD to use supervisord instead of direct node execution
  - Change container startup command to use supervisord
  - Ensure both processes start correctly under process manager
  - Maintain compatibility with existing container behavior
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.3_

- [x] 5. Update health check to monitor both Node.js and cloudflared processes
  - Modify existing health check script to verify Node.js application
  - Add optional cloudflared process verification when tunnel is enabled
  - Ensure health check fails appropriately when required services are down
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 1.5_

- [x] 6. Update docker-compose.yml with cloudflared environment variables
  - Add CLOUDFLARED_TOKEN environment variable with example placeholder
  - Add optional CLOUDFLARED_TUNNEL_NAME environment variable
  - Include comments explaining how to obtain and configure tokens
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 4.2_

- [x] 7. Create documentation for cloudflared setup and configuration
  - Write setup instructions for obtaining cloudflared tokens
  - Document environment variable configuration options
  - Include troubleshooting guide for common tunnel issues
  - Add security best practices for token management
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 8. Update .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files from cloudflared context
  - Ensure tunnel configuration files are properly included in build context
  - Maintain existing exclusions for development and test files
  - _Requirements: 1.1_

- [x] 9. Test container build and startup with tunnel configuration
  - Write test script to verify container builds successfully with cloudflared
  - Test startup behavior with and without CLOUDFLARED_TOKEN
  - Verify both processes start and remain running under supervisord
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 2.3, 3.1_

- [x] 10. Test health check functionality with multi-process setup
  - Verify health check passes when both services are running
  - Test health check failure scenarios for each service
  - Ensure Docker container status reflects health check results
  - _Requirements: 3.2_
