# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds cloudflared tunnel integration to the Mesa Court Aggregator Docker deployment, enabling secure external access to the application without exposing ports directly or requiring complex firewall configurations. The integration will support both development and production environments with configurable tunnel tokens.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to deploy the court aggregator with cloudflared tunnel support, so that I can securely access the application from anywhere without port forwarding or VPN setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Docker container is built THEN cloudflared binary SHALL be installed and available
2. WHEN a CLOUDFLARED_TOKEN environment variable is provided THEN the tunnel SHALL automatically start and connect
3. WHEN no CLOUDFLARED_TOKEN is provided THEN the application SHALL start normally without tunnel functionality
4. WHEN the tunnel is active THEN the application SHALL remain accessible via the tunnel URL
5. IF the tunnel connection fails THEN the main application SHALL continue running normally

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want flexible cloudflared configuration options, so that I can easily switch between local development and tunneled deployment modes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CLOUDFLARED_TOKEN environment variable is set THEN cloudflared SHALL use that token for authentication
2. WHEN CLOUDFLARED_TUNNEL_NAME is provided THEN cloudflared SHALL use the specified tunnel name
3. WHEN no tunnel configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL default to local-only access
4. WHEN tunnel configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL log appropriate error messages and continue without tunnel

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper process management for cloudflared, so that both the web application and tunnel remain stable and can be monitored independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the container starts THEN both the Node.js application and cloudflared SHALL run as separate processes
2. WHEN either process fails THEN the container health check SHALL reflect the failure status
3. WHEN the container stops THEN both processes SHALL terminate gracefully
4. WHEN monitoring the container THEN logs from both processes SHALL be accessible and distinguishable

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation and examples, so that I can quickly set up and configure cloudflared tunnels for different deployment scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing documentation THEN clear instructions SHALL be provided for obtaining cloudflared tokens
2. WHEN setting up development environment THEN example environment variables SHALL be documented
3. WHEN deploying to production THEN security best practices for token management SHALL be documented
4. WHEN troubleshooting THEN common issues and solutions SHALL be documented
