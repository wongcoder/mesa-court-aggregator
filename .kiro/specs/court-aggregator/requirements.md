# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Court Aggregator is a cross-platform application that consolidates court availability information from multiple reservation systems into a single, user-friendly interface. The system will cache API responses to minimize external API calls and provide users with a clear overview of court availability across different locations. The application will feature a sleek, modern interface comparable to Kiro's design standards and will run efficiently on Unix/Linux systems with daily data updates.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a court player, I want to see all available courts across multiple locations in one place, so that I don't have to check multiple reservation systems individually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the application THEN the system SHALL display a consolidated view of all court locations
2. WHEN court data is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the location name, total courts, booked courts, and available courts for each location
3. WHEN multiple locations have courts THEN the system SHALL present them in an organized, easy-to-scan format
4. IF a location has no available courts THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate "fully booked" status

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a court player, I want to see real-time court availability for today, so that I can quickly identify where I can play.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display current day court availability by default
2. WHEN displaying availability THEN the system SHALL show time slots starting from 9:00 AM and their booking status
3. WHEN displaying time slots in the UI THEN the system SHALL show hourly time windows (9:00 AM, 10:00 AM, etc.) while maintaining 30-minute granularity internally
4. WHEN a court is partially booked THEN the system SHALL indicate both booked and available time slots
5. IF no courts are available at any location THEN the system SHALL display a clear "no availability" message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to cache API responses efficiently, so that we don't overwhelm the external reservation APIs with requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system fetches court data THEN it SHALL store the response in monthly JSON files
2. WHEN cached data exists and is less than 24 hours old THEN the system SHALL use cached data instead of making new API calls
3. WHEN the system updates data THEN it SHALL refresh the cache daily at 5PM PST
4. WHEN the system starts up THEN it SHALL run a backfill job to preload data from today to two weeks ahead
5. WHEN running the backfill job THEN the system SHALL make separate API requests for each date and facility group
6. IF an API call fails THEN the system SHALL use the most recent cached data and log the error

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a court player, I want the application to have multiple calendar views (monthly, weekly, daily) similar to Google Calendar, so that I can visualize court availability at different levels of detail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the application THEN the system SHALL display a monthly calendar grid by default
2. WHEN displaying court bookings THEN the system SHALL show time blocks within each day cell representing booked periods
3. WHEN showing different parks THEN the system SHALL use distinct colors for each park's booking blocks
4. WHEN the user navigates between time periods THEN the system SHALL maintain the calendar layout and load appropriate data
5. IF the interface displays multiple parks THEN the system SHALL organize them in a clear, non-overlapping visual format

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a court player, I want to switch between monthly, weekly, and daily calendar views, so that I can see court availability at the level of detail that's most useful for my planning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the calendar interface loads THEN the system SHALL provide view toggle buttons for Monthly, Weekly, and Daily views
2. WHEN the user clicks the Weekly view button THEN the system SHALL display a 7-day week grid with detailed time slots
3. WHEN the user clicks the Daily view button THEN the system SHALL display a single day with hourly time slots and detailed court information
4. WHEN switching between views THEN the system SHALL maintain the current date context and park filter selections
5. WHEN in weekly view THEN the system SHALL show more detailed time information than monthly view
6. WHEN in daily view THEN the system SHALL show the most granular court and time slot details
7. IF the user navigates to a different time period THEN the system SHALL remember the selected view type

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to work reliably across different operating systems, so that it can be deployed in various environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is installed THEN it SHALL run on Unix and Linux operating systems
2. WHEN the system starts up THEN it SHALL initialize properly regardless of the underlying OS
3. WHEN handling file paths and system operations THEN the system SHALL use cross-platform compatible approaches
4. IF system-specific features are needed THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle OS differences

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a court player, I want to filter which parks are displayed in the calendar, so that I can focus on only the locations I'm interested in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the calendar is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a sidebar with checkboxes for each park
2. WHEN a user unchecks a park THEN the system SHALL hide that park's booking blocks from the calendar
3. WHEN a user checks a park THEN the system SHALL show that park's booking blocks in the calendar
4. IF the user wants to quickly toggle all parks THEN the system SHALL provide "Select All" and "Deselect All" options

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a court player, I want to see detailed information about court bookings when I need it, so that I can understand exactly which courts are available and when.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hovering over a booking block THEN the system SHALL display a tooltip with specific court and time information
2. WHEN clicking on a day THEN the system SHALL show an expanded view with detailed park information
3. WHEN viewing detailed information THEN the system SHALL show which specific courts are booked and their time periods
4. IF no bookings exist for a day THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate that all courts are available

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to handle multiple API endpoints efficiently, so that we can aggregate data from various court systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN the system SHALL support multiple API endpoints with the same response format
2. WHEN fetching data THEN the system SHALL make concurrent requests to all configured endpoints
3. WHEN an endpoint is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue processing other endpoints and log the failure
4. IF new endpoints need to be added THEN the system SHALL support configuration-based endpoint management

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to handle errors gracefully, so that users always have a functional experience even when external systems fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API endpoint is unreachable THEN the system SHALL display cached data with a timestamp indicating when it was last updated
2. WHEN the JSON cache is unavailable THEN the system SHALL attempt to fetch fresh data and display it without caching
3. WHEN all data sources fail THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message with suggested actions
4. IF partial data is available THEN the system SHALL display what it can and indicate which locations have stale or missing data

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a court player, I want to access official court calendar PDFs when available, so that I can view the official reservation documents for additional details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a park has an associated PDF calendar THEN the system SHALL display a helper link to access it
2. WHEN the user clicks the helper link THEN the system SHALL open the official PDF calendar in a new tab
3. WHEN displaying park information THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which parks have PDF calendars available
4. IF a park does not have a PDF calendar THEN the system SHALL not display a helper link for that park

### Requirement 12

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to run reliably on a Raspberry Pi, so that it can operate as a low-cost, always-on service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed on a Raspberry Pi THEN it SHALL use minimal system resources
2. WHEN the Pi reboots THEN the system SHALL automatically restart the application service
3. WHEN the daily update runs THEN it SHALL complete without overwhelming the Pi's limited resources
4. IF the Pi loses network connectivity temporarily THEN the system SHALL continue serving cached data and resume updates when connectivity returns
