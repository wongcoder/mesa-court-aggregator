# Docker E2E Test Results - SUCCESS! üéâ

## What We Fixed

### 1. Supervisord Privilege Issues ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: Supervisord couldn't drop privileges properly
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed `USER courtapp` from Dockerfile (supervisord needs root to manage processes)
  - Added `user=root` to supervisord.conf
  - Individual programs still run as `courtapp` user for security

### 2. Environment Variable Issues ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: Supervisord couldn't expand `ENV_CLOUDFLARED_TOKEN` variables
- **Solution**: Removed environment variable expansion from supervisord.conf, let the shell script handle it directly

### 3. Cloudflared Command Issues ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: Invalid `--name` flag usage
- **Solution**: Fixed tunnel-start.sh to use proper cloudflared syntax

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Working Components
- **Docker build**: Builds successfully
- **Container startup**: Starts and stays healthy
- **Node.js application**: Running on port 3000
- **Health endpoint**: Responding correctly (`/health`)
- **Supervisord**: Managing processes properly
- **Data persistence**: Volume mounts working
- **Environment configuration**: .env file loaded correctly

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issue
- **Cloudflared tunnel**: DNS resolution issue in Docker environment
  - This is a common Docker networking issue
  - The main application works fine without the tunnel
  - Can be resolved with DNS configuration or running on actual Pi

## How to Use

### Start the Application
```bash
# Start with docker-compose
docker compose up -d

# Check status
docker compose ps

# View logs
docker compose logs -f
```

### Test the Application
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Web interface
open http://localhost:3000

# Detailed health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

### Monitor Processes
```bash
# Check supervisord status
docker exec mesa-court-aggregator supervisorctl status

# View individual process logs
docker exec mesa-court-aggregator supervisorctl tail nodejs
docker exec mesa-court-aggregator supervisorctl tail cloudflared
```

### Stop the Application
```bash
docker compose down
```

## Deployment to Raspberry Pi

The Docker configuration is now ready for your Raspberry Pi:

1. **Transfer files** to your Pi
2. **Install Docker Engine** (not Desktop):
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
   sudo sh get-docker.sh
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   ```
3. **Configure environment**:
   ```bash
   cp sample.env .env
   # Edit .env with your settings
   ```
4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

## Architecture Benefits

Your Docker setup provides:

- **Multi-process management** via supervisord
- **Security** with non-root application processes
- **Health monitoring** built into the container
- **Data persistence** with volume mounts
- **Easy updates** with container rebuilds
- **Process isolation** and resource management
- **Consistent deployment** across environments

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Pi**: Use the working Docker configuration
2. **DNS fix for tunnel**: Configure proper DNS or use host networking
3. **Monitoring**: Set up log aggregation and monitoring
4. **Backup**: Implement data backup strategy

The core application is working perfectly in Docker! üöÄ
